    <div><p>Hi, my name is Maksym Prokopov. I&rsquo;m in love with technology. That&rsquo;s my passion and what I do on my daily job and beyond.</p>
<p>Before I got my first computer Intel 386 DX 40 in 1994, I used to write tiny programs on my MK61 programmable calculator. This was unforgettable experience and my first exposure to the von Neumann architecture. Soviet computer Corvette helped me to dive into programming when I was something like 13. Since then my journey didn&rsquo;t end and I falled completely in love with the software engineering.</p>
<p><img src="mk-61-1.png#center" alt="Mk 61" title="MK61 Soviet programmable calculator, gifted me first exposue to programming"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This thing was amazing, unfortunately I had to input a program again and again after turning it off. It simply didn&rsquo;t have any storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Internet came to me in form of offline access at my programming verein. I remember very very well that excitement from flying and bouncing text animated by Javascript in Netscape Navigator. I created it by myself in 1996!</p>
<p>Started my adult career with PHP 3.0.3 by building first ever web site with frames and relatively big MySQL databate with something like 30000 SKUs. Now I clearly realise, SQL injection was definitely a part of work, but nobody&rsquo;s perfect, right?</p>
<p>Then in 2001 I joined [DOM.COM] agency. We built a lot of nice web sites, unfortunately, our sales team had to explain companies why they needed a website and things didn&rsquo;t go well.</p>
<p>Since 2006 I started doing Ruby on Rails a lot. 2015 got addicted to Clojure and ClojureScript and did some <a href="https://github.com/mprokopov/privat24-manager">production-ready things</a>.</p>
<p>In 2007 with partner Alexander we launched <a href="https://it-premium.com.ua">IT-Premium</a> company, that delivers best IT-support services for organizations.</p>
<p>In 2016 with another partner Alexey we launched internet-shop Super-Truper.com.ua. 2018 I sold my 50% share to Alexey.</p>
<p>In 2020 managed to <a href="https://in.harbour.space/computer-science/dev-ops-maksym-prokopov-2020/?fbclid=IwAR0Zpb0_L-FItZp54Sn_hRYeeL3O0P9AscSMO-emlucEpMuh8zei9pHq-Ig">deliver a DevOps course</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2020 I moved from Kyiv to Freiburg in Greisgau, Germany.</p>
<p>The most important thing for a human being I believe is to be happy and share happiness with environment, and to increase kindness.</p>
<p>Appreciate your comments and reviews if anything I wrote about turned to be beneficial for you.</p>
