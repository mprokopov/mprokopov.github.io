Ruby has so much inspiration from the Smalltalk!

Here are my findings:

- Inspect method actually opens an inspector for the object in Smalltalk, Ruby just tries to show object’s guts
- collect, select are methods for collections from the Smalltalk
- do for collection in Smalltalk is the same what’s in Ruby each
- block parameter in «pipes» in Ruby is very similar to Smalltalk
- `super` is calling the `superclass` parent method
- initialize is a constructor name for the class in Smalltalk
- keywords concept has slightly different syntax, but the meaning is the same
- << method
- Ruby object.send method = Smaltalk object perform: method
- the self keyword means the same in Smalltalk and Ruby
