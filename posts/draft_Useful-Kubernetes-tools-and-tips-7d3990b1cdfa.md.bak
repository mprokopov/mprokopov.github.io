Unlike docker-compose sometimes kubectl provides you better tooling for docker container access.

Let me share with you my useful findings.

With port-forward, you can easily connect to pods service and debug it.

```
kubectl port-forward podname port
```

For example

```
kubectl port-forward sharepass-78d566f866-4dvv5 3000
```

> kubectl port-forward sharepass-78d566f866–4dvv5 3000  
> Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3000 -> 3000  
> Forwarding from \[::1\]:3000 -> 3000  
> Handling connection for 3000  
> Handling connection for 3000

This will forward port 3000 to localhost, so you can open URL [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) and enjoy access to your service.
