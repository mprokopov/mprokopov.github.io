This is really my little timesaver because you know, a lot of meetings happen when you work remotely.

Works best with Alfred 4 using mapped hotkey.

```applescript
tell application "Calendar"
	tell calendar "maksym.prokopov@trilogy.com"
		set itemLocation to location of first event where its start date ≤ (current date) + 10 * minutes and end date ≥ (current date)
		if itemLocation contains "zoom.us" then tell application "Finder" to open location itemLocation
	end tell
end tell
```
