Short answer: use [https://github.com/geminabox/geminabox](https://github.com/geminabox/geminabox) for caching gems on your own host, or in your local network.

I was using bundlerâ€™s vendor/cache in docker container, but with such improvement my container size grown up to 1,2Gb very quickly.

Supply following settings to your **geminabox** container  
`RUBYGEMS_PROXY=true`
